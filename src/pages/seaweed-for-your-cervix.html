      <p>A little fact.</p>

      <p>Well into the 1900s, they would still use seaweed to dilate a women’s cervix. These bits of seaweed came from the stipe (stalk) of the Laminar digitata plant and were boasted as the cheapest, easiest, most effective and cleanest option. These dry bits seaweed, 5-10cm long would expand over 10 hours in the cervical canal, a less painful option than any of the faster alternatives.</p>

      <p>If you are a person who has/ had a cervix, this all may be too nauseating to think of. Maybe some wouldn’t mind having one such ‘natural’ alternative back in this age of Goop. For now, they are history as they were infamously resistant to sterilisation.</p>
