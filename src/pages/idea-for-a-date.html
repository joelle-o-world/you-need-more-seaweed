      <h1>walking through seaweed</h1>
      <p>It doesn't appear that Ian Hamilton Finley had any particular obsession with seaweed. Two girls talk about it in one of his short plays, that is all. Maybe he liked to walk through seaweed, or maybe he thought it foolish. Either way, don't focus on him, think of 'Second Girl' and how she gets painfully rejected by 'First Girl' after suggesting the seaweed date.</p>

        Here are a few excerpts from the play:
