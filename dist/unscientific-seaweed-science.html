      <h1>Unscientific Seaweed Science</h1>
      <p>Women living in Victorian Britain had few opportunities for outdoor activities. Hunting was thought too dangerous for such docile creatures. Gardening required digging and bending down, suggestive and inappropriate movements. Botany was far worse as it dealt with plant sex, an x-rated topic.</p>

      <p>Faced with such misogynistic nonsense they found seaweed. It became very popular for women to escape to the coastline, collecting samples to log in albums and herbarium sheets. It became a quite a fad. Enjoyed by Queen Victoria and George Elliot even. Men partook too but, whilst their work was considered scientific research, for women it was just a sentimental amusement.</p>

      
      <p>Yet, they forged a market for their work despite this belittlement. Working in a liminal realm between arts and sciences, they were exempt from the formalities of these disciplines. Their written reports retained the heady freedom of the experience, much more interesting than the dull taxonomies of the ‘scientists’ . They presented their specimens as drawings or often pressed in collages. <a href='https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/archives/set/67069'>Eliza Jordson</a> arranged them in pretty pictures surrounded by with doilies. <a href="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/photographs-of-british-algae-cyanotype-impressions#/?tab=about">Anna Atkins</a>a used blueprinting and published the first book ever to be made entirely by photographic means.</p>

      <p>Their work was testament to their technical abilities in painstakingly preserving, mounting and curating their specimens. Amelia Griffiths named and documented over 250 species, many before any ‘scientists’. She donated her samples and work to many of these ‘scientists’ for their own <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/101638#page/1/mode/1up">publications</a> (he does credit her at least!).</p>

      

      <p>Making albums of pressed wildflowers was also a popular hobby, but the specialism in seaweed grew from its links to the restorative benefits of the coast. Many women suffering sickness retreated to the seaside. Margaret Getty made such an escape after enduring seven pregnancies. Free from domestics, she scoured for seaweeds. Her <a href="https://archive.org/details/britishseaweedsd21872gatt/page/n37/mode/2up">British Sea- Weeds</a>, was highly praised as a masterpiece of algology with over 80 illustrations and descriptions. </p>

      <p>I think some found solace in seaweed. Dwelling with this, often forgotten, weed in the margins. They brought recognition to this humble plant and in turn some recognition to themselves. </p>

      <p>A favourite poem included in many albums: </p>

      <blockquote>
        Ah! Call us not weeds -<br>
        We are flowers of the sea<br>
        For lovely and bright<br>
        And gay tinted are we - <br>
        We are quite independent<br>
        Of culture and showers<br>
        Then call us not weeds<br>
        We are oceans’s gay flower<br>
      </blockquote>
